# - refactor your `initialize` method to use keyword arguments
# - add a `.all` method that returns all persisted appointments and create an `@@all` class variable to store them in
#   - add a `#save` method which persists the `appointment` receiving the method call to `@@all`. This method should return the appointment we call it on.
#   - add a `.create` method which accepts attributes as an argument, uses them to instantiate a new instance of the class, and invokes `.save` on the new instance
#   - add a `.by_doctor(doctor)` method which accepts a doctor name as an argument and returns all appointments with that doctor.
#   - add a `.by_patient(patient)` method which accepts a patient name as an argument and returns all appointments with that patient.
